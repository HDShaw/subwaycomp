This is a webpage that shows diagrams of subway systems, to scale.

I use it to satisfy my nerdly desires to intuitively understand the relative
sizes and densities of different systems.

Eventually I might add things to it, such as features.

There are two main parts: one in Python that fetches data from OpenStreetMap,
performs trigonometry thereupon and writes it into files, and another in
Javascript that actually draws the map.

There is no server-side scripting involved here. The data
fetching/processing is done offline, and all the JS does is fetch a
static file and draw stuff. You can use it as a local file in your
browser.

The docs directory is not documentation for the project; it's the web
frontend. I name it docs so I can use Github Pages to host it.

There are some notes in a file called notes.txt, wherein I complain about data
quality in hilarious fashion.

It uses the canvas tag, which is how you know that I am hip with the times.
